# modifications do not limit the invention

See: https://patents.google.com/

<small>***Note**: A high hit count on Google Patents doesn’t prove a phrasing is the most correct in English. Counts are often inflated by boilerplate reused across families (WO/EP/US, A/B publications), OCR duplicates, and machine-translated text that mirrors Dutch/Belgian originals. Such strings may be faithful to the source but non-idiomatic in English. Prefer jurisdiction-standard, idiomatic formulations; treat hit counts as popularity signals, not quality metrics.*</small>
