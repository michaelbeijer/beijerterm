# moratoire interesten

1. # Question
Is **moratory interest** the same as **late payment interest**?

1. # Answer
Yes, **moratory interest** and **late payment interest** are essentially the same thing.

- **Moratory interest** refers to the interest charged on overdue payments as a penalty for late payment. It is often specified in contracts or set by law.
- **Late payment interest** (or **default interest**) is a more commonly used term in everyday English and refers to the same concept: interest accrued due to delayed payment.

In legal and financial contexts, "moratory interest" is sometimes used in formal documents, but "late payment interest" or "default interest" is more commonly understood.
