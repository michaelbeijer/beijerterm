- Belgische Stelsel van Werkloosheid met Bedrijfstoeslag (SWT)

<blockquote>**Chapter VI: Old-age pensions and benefits**

- *When are you entitled to old-age benefits?**

In principle, everyone who has worked in Belgium under an employment contract is insured for old-age benefits. There are special rules for part-time domestic staff.

All employed persons are entitled to an early retirement pension on reaching the age of 60.5, provided they have completed 38 years of professional activity. Normal retirement age for men and women is 65. An exception to this rule is made for miners, seamen and aircrew of civil aviation who can retire earlier.

Men and women in receipt of benefits under the **system of unemployment with company supplement** (*régime de chômage avec complément d'entreprise/stelsel van werkloosheid met bedrijfstoeslag*) are not entitled to a retirement pension (pension de retraite/rustpensioen) before the age of 65.

You will not receive a retirement pension if you are already receiving sickness, invalidity or involuntary unemployment benefit under Belgian or foreign social security legislation, or if you are receiving an allowance for cessation of work or a supplementary allowance under the **system of unemployment with company supplement** (*régime de chômage avec complément d'entreprise/stelsel van werkloosheid met bedrijfstoeslag*).
