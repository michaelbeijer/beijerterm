1. negative skin friction (or downdrag) (Dictionary for Building Technology Terminology (Technische Universiteit Delft)) (Woordenlijst Geotechniek NL-EN (quizlet.com flash cards)(904 Dutch-English terms))
1. positive skin friction

 The skin friction on a pile is caused by the relative movement on the interface between the pile and the soil. By definition, **if the pile settles faster than the adjacent soil, the skin friction is positive; if the soil settles faster than the pile, the skin friction is negative (NSF)** [1]. After long-term monitoring, Fellenius found that all piles in soil experienced NSF and a small relative movement was sufficient to develop NSF [2]. There are important fundamental differences in the behavior of piles with NSF compared to piles without it that affect the structural and geotechnical design [3].

 Negative skin friction is the process where skin friction acts downward due to soil. When skin friction is acting downwards it would decrease the pile capacity. 
 Negative skin friction (also known as downdrag), could be a major problem in some sites.
