# Trunk Call

‘In telecommunications, a long-distance call or **trunk call** is a telephone call made to a location outside a defined local calling area. Long-distance calls are typically charged a higher billing rate than local calls. The term is not necessarily synonymous with placing calls to another telephone area code.’ **Wikipedia**
