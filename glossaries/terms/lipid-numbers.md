# Lipid numbers

**Please note**: The pages in the ‘[Terms](:Category:Terms)’ category contain my own research while translating. I basically use this wiki as a notepad and memory aid, so a lot of the content will be quickly written and potentially far from perfect. If you find anything glaringly incorrect, feel free to drop me a line @ info@superlookup.wiki!
