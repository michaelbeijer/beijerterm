1. ## Notes
 ‘The weight of a fabric depends of the thickness of the threads it’s made of, of the density of the **weave or knit**, as well as its composition (linen for instance is 20% heavier than silk).’ 

 ‘**Woven textiles** are used for most sheets, the fabric surrounding pillows and comforters, and as the outer fabric on mattresses. **Knit textiles** are used in blankets, some sheets, some pillow covers and as the outer fabric on mattresses. 
 
 The main difference between a woven and knit textile is their flexibility or ability to stretch and rebound to their original shape. For instance on the top sleeping surface of a mattress, a woven textile will display an element of resistance and will not flex as much as a knit textile. In the store we often make the analogy of jeans (woven fabric) compared to sweatpants (knit fabric).’
