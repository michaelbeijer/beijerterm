# RVA

The **National Employment Office** (RVA/ONEM) is a federal public agency that primarily protects the rights to unemployment insurance in Belgium. The NEO is the largest public social security agency in Belgium. The NEO’s key missions include determining the right to and the amount of unemployment benefits for involuntary unemployment. Job placement and job training have been the competences of the Regions and Communities since 1989. (https://english.n-va.be/politieke-woordenlijst/neo)
