<blockquote>If you operate an establishment, it’s important to understand the difference between a “**revision permit**” [**revisievergunning**] and a “**modification permit**” [**veranderingsvergunning**]. In a recent ruling (only available in Dutch), the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (the “Council of State”) explained when a revision permit applies. In the case concerned, that meant that enforcement action against the presence of a LPG system at a service station in Uden was correct.
