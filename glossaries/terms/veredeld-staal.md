# veredeld staal

veredeld staal; veredelstaal; veredelingsstaal =
 • steel for hardening and tempering (IATE)
 • heat treatable steels
 • heat-treated steel
 • tempered and hardened steel
 • refined steel (GWIT)(see ChatGPT section below)

1. ## GWIT

- **veredelingsstaal; veredelstaal** (met minder dan 0,045%% P) = special steel, high-grade steel (Comprehensive Dictionary of Industry and Technology (Graham P. Oxtoby) )
- **veredeld staal** = refined steel
- **veredelen** [CHEM.TECHN.] (zuiver maken) purify, enrich, refine, upgrade, improve
- **veredeling** (m.b.t. metalen) refinement, upgrading, breeding, improvement

1. ### Question:
Is "refined steel" synonymous with "tempered and hardened steel"?

1. ### Answer:
No, "refined steel" is not synonymous with "tempered and hardened steel." These terms refer to different processes and characteristics of steel**:**

- *1. Refined steel:**

- Refers to steel that has undergone a purification process to remove impurities and improve its overall quality.
- The refining process typically involves removing excess carbon and other unwanted elements.
- Refined steel is a more general term that doesn't necessarily imply specific mechanical properties.   

- *2. Tempered and hardened steel:**

- This refers to steel that has undergone specific heat treatment processes to enhance its mechanical properties.
- Hardening: Heating the steel to a high temperature and then rapidly cooling it (quenching) to increase its hardness and strength.
- Tempering: A subsequent heat treatment at a lower temperature to reduce brittleness and increase toughness while maintaining most of the hardness gained during hardening.

While refined steel may be of higher quality due to fewer impurities, it doesn't necessarily have the specific mechanical properties associated with tempered and hardened steel. Tempered and hardened steel has undergone additional processes to achieve particular strength, hardness, and toughness characteristics.
