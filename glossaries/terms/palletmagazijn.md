# palletmagazijn

Since the Dutch term "magazijn" can mean anything from an entire warehouse to a magazine on a gun, "palletmagazijn" can refer to installations of varying sizes. 

1. # Dutch

- pallet dispenser (The **pallet dispenser** is a device with a dual purpose. **Firstly**, it functions as **a store for empty pallets**, which can be stored stacked on top of each other (solutions up to a maximum of 12 pallets) while waiting to be used again. **Secondly**, the pallet store makes it possible **to supply the production line with one or more pallets when needed**. The pallet dispenser is able to do this thanks to its integrated conveyor belt (roller or chain) and a fork, which is used to extract a single pallet from the stack of empty pallets and then feed it to the line.
