see: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/v1sfwr/quick_question_for_american_docs_reading_new_do/

 Here in the Netherlands, when a patient has to take a pill 3 times a day of 500mg, we would write "3dd500mg" if we were to communicate this dose to other care providers with medical knowledge. I'm writing something for american docs AND dutch docs and not sure if they would understand this writing. Do you recognize it and are you able to read it and if not, what do you use?
 
 "3dd500mg" = take a pill 3 times a day of 500mg
 
 1dd = three times daily
 2dd = three times daily
 3dd = three times daily
 etc.
 
 FYI the old abbreviations are Latin and they're pretty universal:
 
 QD stands for "quaque die" (one times daily)
 BID stands for "bis in die" (two times daily)
 TID stands for "ter in die" (three times daily)
 QID stands for "quater in die" (four times daily)
