# fumed silica

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumed_silica

1. # English
- *Fumed silica** (also known as **pyrogenic silica**) is an extremely fine, high-surface-area form of silicon dioxide (SiO₂) produced by flame hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride or similar processes. The resulting amorphous, non-porous particles have a primary size of 5–50 nm and a very large surface area (50–600 m²/g).

It is widely used as a rheology modifier, thickener, anti-caking agent, and reinforcing filler in various industrial, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical applications.

1. ## Properties
- High specific surface area
- Low bulk density, fluffy white powder
- Non-porous, amorphous
- Hydrophilic (untreated) or hydrophobic (surface treated)

1. ## Applications
- **Pharmaceuticals/Cosmetics** – as an anti-caking agent, suspending agent, viscosity modifier, and free-flow aid (INCI: *Silica*).
- **Food industry** – as an anti-caking agent (E551).
- **Coatings and adhesives** – to control rheology and prevent settling.
- **Elastomers and plastics** – as a reinforcing filler.
- **Powder formulations** – to improve flow properties and dispersion.

1. # Dutch
The English term *fumed silica* is rendered in Dutch in several ways:

- **pyrogeen siliciumdioxide** – most common and precise translation in technical, pharmaceutical and patent contexts.
- **gepyrolyseerd siliciumdioxide** – alternative form, less frequent but correct.
- **siliciumdioxide (pyrogeen)** – often used in regulatory documents or product datasheets.
- **pyrogeen kiezelzuur** – listed in IATE as the Dutch equivalent of *fumed silica* (though technically *kiezelzuur* is a misnomer for SiO₂, see note below).
- Sometimes the INCI name **Silica** is retained untranslated in cosmetics.

1. ## Terminological note
- Van Dale: *kiezelzuur* = in chemische zin onjuiste benaming voor *siliciumdioxide*, dat in feite *kiezelzuuranhydride* is.  
  → This means that although *kiezelzuur* is historically used, the correct chemical name in Dutch is *siliciumdioxide*.
