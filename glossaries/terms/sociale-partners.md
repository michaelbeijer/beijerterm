# sociale partners

The **social partners** in Belgium are the officially recognised representatives of employers (employer federations) and workers (trade unions) who negotiate collective labour agreements and advise the government on employment and social policies. They play a legally mandated role in Belgian governance, with many labour laws requiring their consultation or agreement before implementation.
