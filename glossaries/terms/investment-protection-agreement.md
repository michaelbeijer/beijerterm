# investment protection agreement

- Investment protection agreement* (**IPA**) is a historically accurate English rendering used in translations of Dutch archival documents from the 1970s–1980s. It corresponds to the Dutch term **investeringsbeschermingsovereenkomst** (**IBO**). From the early 1990s onward, the international standard term became **bilateral investment treaty** (**BIT**).

1. # English definition
A treaty between two states that provides legal safeguards for foreign investors. Typical provisions include protection against expropriation, the free transfer of profits, fair and equitable treatment, and access to international arbitration.

1. # Usage notes
- **IPA** was used in period-appropriate translations of Dutch diplomatic texts in the 1970s–1980s.  
- The shift in terminology occurred in the early 1990s, when **BIT** became the dominant international term.  
- Modern Dutch usage corresponds to **bilateraal investeringsverdrag** (→ *bilateral investment treaty*).
