([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refuse-derived_fuel](wikipedia:Refuse-derived_fuel#:~:text=Refuse%2Dderived%20fuel%20(RDF),industrial%20waste%20or%20commercial%20waste.&text=RDF%20consists%20largely%20of%20combustible,labels%2C%20and%20other%20corrugated%20materials.))

1. # Difference between RDF and SRF
 **What is refuse derived fuel?**
 Refuse derived fuel (RDF) is produced from domestic and business waste, which includes biodegradable material as well as plastics. Non-combustible materials such as glass and metals are removed, and the residual material is then shredded. Refuse derived fuel is used to generate energy at recovery facilities, many of them in Europe where they produce electricity and hot water for communal heating systems.
 
 **What is solid recovered fuel?**
 Solid recovered fuel (SRF) is a high-quality alternative to fossil fuel and is produced from mainly commercial waste including paper, card, wood, textiles and plastic.
 
 Solid recovered fuel has gone through additional processing to improve the quality and value. It has a higher calorific value than RDF and is used in facilities such as cement kilns.
