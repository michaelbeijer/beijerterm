# walsolie

Dutch: walsolie; rolwalsolie
 English: rolling oil
 
 Rolling oil is a lubricant used in metal rolling processes. It serves to:
 
 * Reduce friction between the metal workpiece and the rolling mill rolls
 * Cool the metal and rolls during the rolling process
 * Prevent metal adhesion to the rolls
 * Improve surface finish quality
 * Extend roll life
 
 Rolling oils can be either neat (undiluted) oils or water-based emulsions, depending on the specific rolling operation and metal type.
