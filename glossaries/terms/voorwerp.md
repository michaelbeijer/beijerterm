# voorwerp

= voorwerp =

- *voorwerp** is a technical legal term in Belgian and Dutch corporate law, most commonly encountered in the context of company statutes and notarial deeds. It denotes the set of activities a company is legally empowered to carry out under its articles of association.

1. # Meaning in corporate law
In the statutory context, *voorwerp* refers to the company’s legally defined **object** (also called the **corporate object**). It is not to be confused with business goals or commercial aims.

The term appears frequently in notarial deeds, coordinated articles of association and publications in the *Belgisch Staatsblad* / *Moniteur belge*.

1. # Example of usage
- **voorwerp van de vennootschap**  
  **Translation:** *corporate object* or *object of the company*  
  This denotes the full description of the activities which the company is authorised to perform. It forms part of the mandatory elements of the articles of association.

1. # Recommended translation
- **voorwerp** → *object*  
- **voorwerp van de vennootschap** → *corporate object*

These translations follow standard practice in English-language versions of Belgian notarial deeds and align with the traditional rendering of “objects clause”.
