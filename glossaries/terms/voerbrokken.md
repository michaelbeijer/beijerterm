1. # Usage examples
- “Most commercially produced dog food is made with animal feed grade ingredients and comes dry in bags (also known in the US as ***kibble***) or wet in cans. Dry food contains 6–10% moisture by volume, as compared to 60–90% in canned food. Semi-moist products typically run 25–35%. Isotopic analysis of dog food in the Brazilian market have found that they are basically made of maize and poultry by-products.” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_food)
- “**Kibble** may refer to: Dry compound feed, especially when used as dog food or cat food” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibble)
- “**kibble**: ground meal shaped into pellets, especially for pet food”: *Stuff you wouldn't want to eat but the dog might like: dried liver, plain old (good quality) dog kibble, dry cat food, other pre-made dog treats.* (Oxford Dictionaries Premium)
- U.S. native speaker here. Yes, we use "kibble." It means dry pellets of ground pet food.  I just checked with my wife, who's a retired veterinary technician, and she confirms what I thought: the word can be used BOTH an **uncountable noun**--"We feed our **dog kibble**," AND as a **countable noun** for the individual pellets, "To give your dog this medicine, try hiding the pill among **the kibbles**."
