 **run-in and run-out zone**
 Assuming this is about the required amount of distance the paver machine needs before and after the screed (rather than needing to start/warm up or run out its engine), I think this is correct.
 
 see e.g.:
 
 https://www.nzta.govt.nz/assets/res­ources/research/reports/4...
 
 ‘The design of stabilised pavements in New Zealand
 … 
 For the stabilisation process, trenches 26m long by 5m wide were excavated outside the CAPTIF building for each material. The trenches had 5m **run-in and run-out zones** to allow the machine to reach equilibrium before material was used in the track. A total thickness of 340mm of GAP65 material was laid in two lifts and compacted to 95% of maximum dry density (2.11t/m3) at its OWC (4.0%).’
