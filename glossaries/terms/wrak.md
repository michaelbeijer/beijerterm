# wrak

- wreck, wrecked ship/car (auto, schip, vliegtuig; wrakstuk) 
- (verlaten scheepswrak) derelict
- salvage (the remains of a damaged vehicle that is considered a total loss but still has recoverable value)

- *Example of usage**: The term **total loss** is also often misused. It actually means the insurance company made a complete financial loss, i.e. they recovered no money from the sale of the **salvage** and therefore made a total financial loss on the claim.
