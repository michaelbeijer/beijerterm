# specular highlight

The term **specular** is most commonly used in physics, computer graphics and optics. It refers to *mirror-like* reflection of light from a surface, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This contrasts with **diffuse** reflection, where light scatters in many directions.
 
 Contexts where "specular" is used:
 
 **Physics and optics**:
 Specular reflection is what you see when you look into a mirror or a perfectly calm body of water – you can see clear images reflected.
 
 **Computer graphics**:
 Specular highlights are the bright spots on shiny objects that come from a strong light source. These simulate the mirror-like reflection of light, making 3D models appear glossy or polished.
