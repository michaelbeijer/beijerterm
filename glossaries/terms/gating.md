# gating

1. ## ⚙️ 1. What “gating” means in cardiac CT
In cardiac (and sometimes respiratory) CT imaging, **gating** refers to the technique of **synchronising image acquisition with a physiological signal**, usually the **electrocardiogram (ECG)**.

- The CT scanner collects projection data only during selected portions of the cardiac cycle (e.g. when the heart is relatively still).
- This minimises motion artefacts and can optimise radiation dose.

So:

- **Gating** = signal-synchronised acquisition (ECG-gestuurde acquisitie)
- **Gate 1, Gate 2, etc.** = specific phase windows (tijdvensters) in the cardiac cycle when the scanner uses full-dose acquisition.

1. ## ⚙️ 2. Accepted Dutch renderings
In OEM and clinical texts (Philips, Siemens, Canon, Radboudumc, UMC Utrecht, etc.), the established Dutch equivalents are:

| English | Recommended Dutch | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| gating | **gating** *(retained)* or **ECG-gestuurde acquisitie** | *Gating* is often kept untranslated in UI/protocols; if explained once, “ECG-gestuurde acquisitie” clarifies meaning. |
| gated acquisition | **ECG-gestuurde acquisitie** or **gating-acquisitie** |  |
| gate | **venster**, **fase**, or **gating-venster** | Refers to a selected phase window. |
| Gate 1, Gate 2 | **Gate 1 (Venster 1)**, **Gate 2 (Venster 2)** | Keep English term (UI element), add Dutch in brackets. |
