# snel schakelen

- **snel schakelen*** (or *snelle schakeling*) is a Dutch business cliché often used to suggest flexibility, agility, or the ability to respond quickly to changes.

1. ## Usage notes
The phrase is frequently found in marketing and corporate texts (e.g. websites, brochures) to highlight speed, adaptability, or short decision-making cycles. A literal rendering (*switch quickly*) is rarely idiomatic in English; context-driven choices such as *act quickly* or *move fast* are usually preferable. In more polished marketing copy, *agile* or *flexible* can also be suitable alternatives.
