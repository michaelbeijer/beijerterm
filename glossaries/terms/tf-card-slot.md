# TF card slot

- *TF Card vs. MicroSD Card**: "TF card" stands for "TransFlash card". This is an obsolete term for what is now universally known as a microSD card. A modern user is much more likely to recognise "microSD" than "TF". Translating it literally to **TF-kaartsleuf** could cause confusion. I recommend translating this as **microSD-kaartsleuf**.
