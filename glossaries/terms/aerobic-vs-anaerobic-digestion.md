# aerobic vs anaerobic digestion

Aerobic and anaerobic digestion are two types of microbial processes used to break down organic matter. 

- *Aerobic digestion**, also known as composting, occurs in the presence of oxygen and breaks down organic waste into carbon dioxide, water, and other biomass. 

- *Anaerobic digestion**, on the other hand, occurs in the absence of oxygen and produces methane gas, carbon dioxide, and other biomass, according to ScienceDirect.com.

<u>Aerobic Digestion</u>:

- **Oxygen Required**: Aerobic digestion uses oxygen to break down organic matter. 
- **End Products**: The primary end products are carbon dioxide and water, along with other biomass. 
- **Examples**: Composting, activated sludge systems in wastewater treatment. 
- **Advantages**: Can be more efficient at removing certain nutrients, and often produces a stable, odor-free product.

<u>Anaerobic Digestion</u>:

- **No Oxygen Required**: Anaerobic digestion occurs in the absence of oxygen. 
- **End Products**: The main end product is biogas, which is primarily methane, along with carbon dioxide and other biomass. 
- **Examples**: Wastewater treatment, biogas production from waste. 
- **Advantages**: Can be more energy-efficient, produces biogas for renewable energy, and requires less space. 
- **Disadvantages**: Can produce foul odors if not managed properly.
