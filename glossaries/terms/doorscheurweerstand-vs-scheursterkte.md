# doorscheurweerstand vs scheursterkte

See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_resistance

In Dutch technical and patent texts relating to materials, films, textiles, and nonwovens, the terms **doorscheurweerstand** and **scheursterkte** are often used to describe different aspects of a material’s resistance to tearing. Although they sound similar, they refer to distinct mechanical properties, each with its own standardised testing methods and preferred English equivalents.

1. # Doorscheurweerstand
; English: **tear propagation resistance** (preferred), sometimes **tear resistance** or **propagational breaking strength**

The term *doorscheurweerstand* literally means “resistance to continued tearing”. It measures how well a material resists the propagation of an existing tear once a slit or cut has been made. This property is particularly relevant for nonwovens, films, and flexible packaging materials that may be punctured or notched during handling.

Typical test methods include:
- ASTM D4533 – Tongue (trouser) tear test for nonwoven fabrics  
- ISO 9073-4 – Determination of tear resistance of nonwovens  
- Elmendorf-type tests (ASTM D1922) for thin films

In English patent and materials terminology, *doorscheurweerstand* is best translated as **tear propagation resistance**. This phrasing precisely reflects the concept of resistance to the *continuation* of a tear, not the initial tearing force.

1. ## IATE terminology
According to the InterActive Terminology for Europe (IATE, EU, 2019 – domain: Production, technology and research), *doorscheurweerstand* has the following English equivalents:
- **propagational breaking strength**
- **tear resistance**
- **tear strength**

Among these, **tear propagation resistance** (a near-synonym of *propagational breaking strength*) is the most accurate and contextually appropriate choice for patents, as it aligns with ASTM and ISO standards referring to the propagation of a tear rather than its initiation.

1. # Scheursterkte
; English: **tear strength**

- Scheursterkte* refers to the maximum force required to initiate or complete a tear in a material. It represents the overall tearing strength, rather than the material’s behaviour once a tear has started to propagate. This property is commonly determined using tests such as:
- ASTM D5035 – Strip test for breaking and tearing strength of fabrics  
- ISO 13937-1 – Determination of tear force using the trouser-tear method

In most cases, *scheursterkte* is translated as **tear strength** in English. This is the standard term for the maximum force that a material can withstand before tearing.

1. # Summary

| Dutch term !! Preferred English equivalent !! Focus of test !! Typical standards |
|---|
| *doorscheurweerstand* \|\| **tear propagation resistance** \|\| Resistance to the continuation of an existing tear \|\| ASTM D4533, ISO 9073-4 |
| *scheursterkte* \|\| **tear strength** \|\| Maximum force required to initiate or complete a tear \|\| ASTM D5035, ISO 13937-1 |

1. # Notes for translators
In Dutch patents, *doorscheurweerstand* and *scheursterkte* often appear together in lists of mechanical properties. They should not be translated identically.  
- Use **tear propagation resistance** for *doorscheurweerstand*.  
- Use **tear strength** for *scheursterkte*.  

This distinction aligns your translation with both **IATE terminology** and **international ASTM/ISO standards**, ensuring terminological precision and consistency across patent, scientific, and technical documentation.
