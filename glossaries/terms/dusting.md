- *Dusting** refers to the act of applying a fine, dry powder onto a surface, object, or body part. The term is used in various technical, medical, cosmetic, agricultural, and industrial contexts. In general, dusting implies the even sprinkling or dispersal of solid particles in powder form, often for functional or protective purposes.

1. # Definition
Dusting is the process of delivering a powder in a thin, uniform layer by sprinkling, scattering, or mechanical application. Unlike spraying (which involves liquids or aerosols), dusting is specific to powders and dry particulates. The action may be performed manually (by shaking or sprinkling) or mechanically (via dispensers, blowers, or specialized applicators).

1. # Etymology
The English verb *to dust* derives from Middle English *dusten*, related to Old English *dūst* (meaning "dust, fine powder"). In English, the word has both positive (to apply dust or powder) and negative (to remove dust) senses, depending on context. In technical usage, "dusting" typically refers to the former.

1. # Applications

1. ## Cosmetics and Dermatology
In cosmetics, dusting describes the application of loose powder to skin or hair. Examples include:
- Dusting powders for infants (e.g. talcum powder).
- Cosmetic face powders.
- Dry shampoos applied by direct dusting to scalp and hair.
- Medicinal dusting powders for soothing irritated skin, absorbing moisture, or delivering active pharmaceutical ingredients.

Typical Dutch translations in this context include *bestrooiing*, *poederapplicatie*, and *poederverstuiving*.

1. ## Pharmacology and Medicine
Dusting powders are recognized dosage forms in pharmacy, used for topical administration of drugs to the skin, wounds, or mucous membranes. They are usually free-flowing, fine powders designed for external use.

Standards for pharmaceutical dusting powders are found in pharmacopoeias such as the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).

1. ## Agriculture and Pest Control
In agriculture, dusting refers to applying powdered pesticides, fungicides, or fertilizers to plants, soil, or livestock. Historically, sulphur and DDT were widely applied by crop dusting (aerial dusting by aircraft) before environmental restrictions.

In veterinary medicine, dusting powders are used against ectoparasites such as lice or mites.

1. ## Industry
Industrial dusting may involve applying powders for lubrication, mould release, surface treatment, or fire suppression. Dusting can also describe unintended processes, such as powder build-up in production environments.

1. # Translation
In Dutch technical and patent contexts, *dusting* can be translated as:
- **bestrooiing** – neutral and idiomatic for sprinkling powders.
- **poederapplicatie** – formal, technical; emphasizes application.
- **poederverstuiving** – stresses dispersal by air or mechanical means.
- **poederen** – more cosmetic and colloquial, used in everyday contexts.
- *Dusting off*:
- * **afstoffen, afschuieren, afkloppen** – literal, for removing dust.
- * **opfrissen, ophalen (oude kennis/vaardigheid)** – figurative, for brushing up skills or knowledge.
- **pak slaag** – slang/colloquial, for “a beating” (*to give someone a dusting*).
- **bestuiven** – literal “to dust, to pollinate”; may be used for fine powder dispersal but often evokes pollen/pollination.
- **dun laagje (poeder)** – descriptive usage, “a light coating” or “a fine layer of powder”.
- **(hoge zeegang) het stampen (van schip)** – nautical term; “dusting” can colloquially denote pounding or pitching of a ship in heavy seas.

1. ## Terminology sources
- The InterActive Terminology for Europe (IATE) database records *dusting powder* as *strooipoeder* in pharmaceutical contexts.
- Reverso Context shows frequent Dutch equivalents including *afstoffen*, *bestrooien*, *bestuiven*, *stuiven* and *laagje* depending on context.
- In patent usage, especially with cosmetic or pediculicidal powders, *bestrooiing* and *poederapplicatie* are the recommended renderings.

1. ## Usage notes
In patent and pharmaceutical contexts, translators should prefer **bestrooiing** or **poederapplicatie** for clarity. Other senses such as **pak slaag** or figurative uses belong to informal registers and should not be confused with technical usage.
