1. # Dutch diplomatic shorthand 
In Dutch diplomatic shorthand of that period, **h.t.s.** could indeed mean two different things depending on sentence structure:

1. **hoofd ter standplaats** (*head of post*) – used when referring to the ambassador or the senior diplomat in charge. Example: *“h.t.s. overhandigde …”* = “the head of post handed over …”.
1. **hier ter stede** (*here in this city/place*) – used as an adverbial marker to indicate that something happened locally, in the city where the report is written. Example: *“had eind juli jl. h.t.s. van vice-minister Pavlov vernomen …”* = “had at the end of July here [Moscow](in) learned from Vice-Minister Pavlov …”.
