1. # The Difference Between Contamination, Infection, and Disease
<blockquote>
1. #### Question:
Differentiate between contamination, infection, and disease. What are the possible outcomes of each?

1. #### Contamination, infection and disease
Contamination, infection, and disease are terms that are used in various fields such as biology, medicine, microbiology, etc. They do seem to be similar to each other to the general population but are actually quite different.

1. #### Answer and Explanation:
- *<u>Contamination</u>** is when any contaminant/pollutant or a microorganism is present somewhere it is not intended to be, such as objects or parts of the human body. Contamination could lead to infection and subsequent disease.

- *<u>Infection</u>** is caused by the multiplication of unwanted or harmful microorganisms in the body. This will more than likely trigger an immune response. Infection is typically the first step and is caused by microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, etc.

The **<u>disease</u>** is the damage in the body that results from an infection. This is when signs and symptoms begin or become more prominent. For example, HIV/AIDS is caused by an infection and typically does not show symptoms at the moment of infection. The disease is the manifestation of the results of the infection.

Non infectious entities can also cause diseases. For example, hypertension is a disease from damaged cells and tissues and is not caused by an infection.
