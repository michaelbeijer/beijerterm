# Adelaarsvleugels

1. # Op adelaarsvleugels gedragen
- *src of phrase**:<blockquote>**Deuteronomy 32:11-12** *New International Version (NIV)*

and hovers over its young,

that spreads its wings to catch them

and carries them aloft.

The Lord alone led him;

no foreign god was with him.</blockquote>

- When I started doing funerals in South Dakota, I was introduced to a song I had never heard before—“On Wings Like Eagles”. It seemed as if almost every family wanted this song used as part of the funeral service for their dearly departed. As time went by, I discovered that there are actually several different songs written on the idea of “On Eagles’ Wings.” But what these different versions have in common is the idea taken from Scripture that God, like an eagle, lifts us from our problems.*

- This idea is based on the behavior of a mother eagle towards her young ones. When she believes that her offspring are strong enough to fly, she breaks up the nest, forcing her chicks to leave it. She then flutters overhead, showing them how to fly and encouraging them to try. If the chicks do not try to fly, she will take them on her wings and soar aloft; then, she will suddenly glide out from under them, briefly leaving them to fly on their own. If they cannot manage to stay aloft, the mother eagle darts back underneath them, takes them on her wings, and returns them safely to the rock upon which the nest was built. God describes Himself in these same terms in Deuteronomy chapter 32: **“He shielded him and cared for him; he guarded him as the apple of his eye, like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions.”***
