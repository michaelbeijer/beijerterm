# mengsel van

1. mixture of
1. reaction mass of
There’s an important distinction between **"mixture of"** and **"reaction mass of"** in regulatory and chemical contexts, especially under **REACH** and **CLP** regulations.

1. ## Key Difference:

- **Mixture of**   ➤ Implies a **simple physical blend** of two or more substances, with no chemical reaction between components.   ➤ Used when the components remain chemically distinct.
- **Reaction mass of**   ➤ Used when two or more substances are **formed together as the result of a chemical reaction**, and **cannot be separated without affecting the stability or composition** of the product.   ➤ A **reaction mass** is **not** a simple blend; it's a **multi-constituent substance** (MCS) under REACH.
