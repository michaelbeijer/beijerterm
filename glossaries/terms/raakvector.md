Tangent vectors are described in the differential geometry of curves in the context of curves in **R**<sup>*n*</sup>. More generally, tangent vectors are elements of a *tangent space* of a differentiable manifold. Tangent vectors can also be described in terms of germs. Formally, a tangent vector at the point  is a linear derivation of the algebra defined by the set of germs at x.")
