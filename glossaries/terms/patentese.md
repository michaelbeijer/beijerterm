# Patentese

Patentese is an informal term used to describe the distinctive style and language conventions commonly found in patent documents. It is often seen as overly formal, repetitive, and syntactically complex, and it serves a specific legal and functional purpose.

1. ## Definition:
- *Patentese** refers to the **highly specialised legal-technical language** used in patent specifications and claims, characterised by:

- **Deliberate redundancy and precision** to minimise ambiguity
- **Excessive length and nesting of sentences**, often with multiple subordinate clauses
- **Use of formal terms like “wherein”, “thereof”, “said”, and “comprising”**
- **Avoidance of idiomatic or colloquial expressions**
- **Verbose definitions of terms**, even for simple concepts
- **Consistent use of boilerplate phrases** (e.g. “In one embodiment…”, “It will be understood that…”)

1. ## 📘 Purpose:
While often criticised for being hard to read, **Patentese exists to**:

- Maximise **legal clarity and enforceability**
- Cover **all potential embodiments and variations**
- Avoid **unintended limitations** through overly narrow wording
- Anticipate possible **challenges during examination or litigation**
