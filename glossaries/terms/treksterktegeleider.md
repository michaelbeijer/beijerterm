# treksterktegeleider

</blockquote>metalen treksterktegeleider = metallic tensile strength member</big>

----

<blockquote>Excessive cable tensile loading increases the optical loss and may cause increased residual strain in the fibre if the cable cannot relax. To avoid this, the maximum tensile strength determined by the cable construction, especially the design of the **strength member**, should not be exceeded.

Note 1 – Where a cable is subjected to permanent loading during its operational life, the fibre should preferably not experience additional strain.

Note 2 – Aerial cable may be attached to a suspension wire. In this case, the **strength member** of the cable need only be designed to support the load during manufacture and installation.
