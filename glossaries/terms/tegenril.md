- reverse crease
- counter-crease, counter crease

 The term "reverse crease" is a term of the art, and well known and understood to those skilled in the art. In essence, when forming a flat blank which can be folded to assemble an article of packaging for a foodstuff, most of the folds are "inward" and require creases to be made on the inner surface of the substrate or web. These inward folds allow the sides and ends of the blank to be folded upwards and inwards to form the article of packaging. A "reverse crease" is a thus crease formed on the outer surface of the substrate or web, to facilitate an outward fold. It is hence a fold in the reverse direction to the majority of the folds present in the assembled article of packaging. A reverse crease is, generally, desired to be avoided in the art of forming articles of packaging, as it requires a further processing step, which can reduce rates of production.
