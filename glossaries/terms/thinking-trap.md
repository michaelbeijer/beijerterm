# thinking trap

- Denkvalkuil – Combines “denken” (thinking) and “valkuil” (pitfall), which is both descriptive and memorable.
- Denkfout – Means “thinking error,” focusing on the mistaken nature of the thought.
- Denkval – A shorter option, simply meaning “thinking trap,” which is easy to understand.
- Gedachtevalkuil – Emphasizes “thought” as well as “pitfall,” making it very clear but slightly longer.
- Denkvalstrik – Uses “valstrik” (trap) for a slightly different nuance but still suggests a mental trap.
