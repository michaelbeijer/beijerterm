<blockquote>

- *IORP Directive**

The EU has recently approved a major revision of the EU legislation on workplace pension schemes – the Directive on Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision.

[…]

– The final text addresses one of the concerns raised by the PLSA throughout the negotiation - the proposal that schemes would be deemed ‘cross-border’ simply by virtue of having beneficiaries (as opposed to active members) in another Member State. This would have turned any scheme with pensioners in Spain or another EU country into a cross-border scheme. Recital 14 now states clearly that IORPs will not become ‘cross-border’ simply because they have beneficiaries in another Member State.
