- Contractors’ all risks (CAR) insurance (What Is Contractors' All Risks (CAR) Insurance?

Contractors' all risks (CAR) insurance is a non-standard insurance policy that provides coverage for property damage and third-party injury or damage claims, the two primary types of risks on construction projects. Damage to property can include improper construction of structures, the damage that happens during a renovation, and damage to temporary work erected on-site. 

Third parties including subcontractors may also become injured while working at the construction site. CAR insurance not only covers those associated risks but also bridges these two types of risks into a common policy designed to cover the gap between exclusions that would otherwise exist if using separate policies.

CAR insurance coverage is common for such construction projects as buildings, water tanks, sewage treatment plans, flyovers, and airports. (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractors-all-risks-car-insurance.asp))
