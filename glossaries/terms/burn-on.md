# burn-on

- **See also**: burnout</big>

In the context of occupational health or psychology, ‘burn-on’ can refer to a state where an individual is on the verge of a burnout, experiencing high levels of stress and pressure but still managing to function and meet work demands. This state can be characterized by persistent stress and fatigue, yet the individual hasn't reached the point of complete mental, emotional, and physical exhaustion that typifies burnout. Essentially, a ‘burn-on’ situation implies a precarious balance where ongoing stress is a constant presence, potentially leading to burnout if not addressed.</big>

Some key characteristics of a burn-on include:</big>

1. Persistent stress: The individual feels constantly under pressure and stressed about their work.</big>
1. Emotional exhaustion: They may feel emotionally drained and depleted, but still push themselves to keep going.</big>
1. Decreased job satisfaction: They may start to lose interest and enjoyment in their work, but continue to work hard despite this.</big>
1. Maintaining outward performance: Despite inner struggles, they manage to maintain their work performance and keep up appearances, which can make it difficult for others to recognize their struggles.</big>
1. Neglecting self-care: They may neglect their own needs and well-being, sacrificing rest, leisure activities, and personal time for work.</big>

A burn-on is a serious condition that, if left unaddressed, can lead to a full burnout. It’s important for individuals and employers to recognize the signs of a burn-on and take proactive steps to manage stress and prevent the situation from escalating into a burnout.</big>
