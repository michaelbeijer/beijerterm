- **Change Can Mixers** are vertical batch mixers where the container or “can” is separate from the mixing head and frame so that batches can be weighed and prepared before going on the mixer as well as be swapped easily.

- **Change-can vs. fixed-tank design**. A **change-can** design multi-shaft mixer allows semi-continuous operation through use of multiple interchangeable vessels, including for mixing, discharging, cleaning and preparation. One vessel is under the mixer while another is in the discharge or clean-up stage, and still another would be the loading area being charged with raw materials for the next run. The fixed-tank design is more common on production multi-shaft mixers in the range of 500 gallons or larger.
