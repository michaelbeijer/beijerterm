# Breaking strength vs breaking force

- *Breaking strength** and **breaking force** are closely related but technically distinct material properties.

1. # Breaking force
The **breaking force** is the **total load** required to cause a specimen to fail under tension.  
- It is expressed in **newtons (N)**.  
- It depends on the specimen’s size, width, and geometry.  
- Example (ASTM D5035): a 50 mm-wide strip fails at 375 N → **breaking force = 375 N**.  

1. # Breaking strength
The **breaking strength** is the **stress at which failure occurs** – the breaking force divided by the specimen’s cross-sectional area (or sometimes width).  
- It is expressed in **N/mm**, **N/cm**, or **MPa**.  
- It reflects the intrinsic tensile strength of the material, independent of specimen dimensions.  
- Example: 375 N ÷ 50 mm = **7.5 N/mm breaking strength**.  

1. # Summary

| Term !! Quantity measured !! Units !! Depends on !! Typical use |
|---|
| **Breaking force** \|\| Total load at rupture \|\| N \|\| Specimen width, geometry \|\| Practical packaging and handling tests |
| **Breaking strength** \|\| Stress at rupture (force per width or area) \|\| N/mm, N/cm, MPa \|\| Material properties only \|\| Material comparison and design calculations |

1. # Notes
- In tensile tests, the term *tensile breaking strength* may be used to emphasise that the force acts in tension.  
- Standards such as ASTM D5035 report **breaking force (N)**, whereas EN ISO 10319 expresses results as **tensile strength (kN/m)**.
