# Dunglish

Dunglish is a term used to describe a form of English that is heavily influenced by Dutch language structures, vocabulary, and idioms. It often occurs when native Dutch speakers translate Dutch expressions directly into English, resulting in awkward or incorrect English phrases. This can include literal translations, incorrect word order, or the use of Dutch idioms that don’t have the same meaning in English. The term is a portmanteau of ‘Dutch’ and ‘English’.</big>
