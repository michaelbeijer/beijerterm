# rookbox

Dutch: rookbox
 English: smoker box; smoke box
 
 In the context of a barbecue, the Dutch term "rookbox" refers to a smoker box or smoke box in English.
 
 A smoker box is a small, typically metal container used to hold wood chips or chunks on a barbecue grill. It’s designed to produce smoke when heated, which infuses food (like meats, fish, or vegetables) with a smoky flavor. It is often placed directly on the grill grates or near the heat source.
