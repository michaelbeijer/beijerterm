# gemengde commissie

- See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_committee_(legislative)

1. # Definition
A **Joint Committee** (Dutch: *gemengde commissie*) is a bilateral or multilateral body composed of representatives from two or more governments, established to oversee or coordinate cooperation in specific areas such as trade, investment, or technical matters.

1. # Usage
In Dutch diplomatic and ministerial documents from the 1980s, the term *gemengde commissie* frequently referred to official bilateral committees between the USSR and partner states (e.g. the *gemengde commissie USSR–Oostenrijk*). These committees typically dealt with economic cooperation, investment agreements, and trade relations.

1. # Translation
The established English equivalent is **Joint Committee**.  
Although literal translations such as *Mixed Commission* are sometimes found in older texts, they are non-standard and should be avoided in modern or official usage. *Joint Committee* is the recognised term in international law and diplomacy, as confirmed by the EU’s IATE database and common treaty practice.
