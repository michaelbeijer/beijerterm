1. # Translating "liggende oriëntatie" in a Dutch patent
In general usage, "liggend" is often best translated as "horizontal."  
However, in highly technical or legal-sensitive contexts – such as patent translation – this may introduce unintended precision.  
The expression "liggende oriëntatie" illustrates this well.

1. ## Option 1: "substantially horizontal orientation" ✓ (safest)
- Accurately reflects the intended “not upright” meaning of *liggend*
- Allows for small deviations from perfect horizontality (important in patents)
- Aligns with standard non-limiting patent drafting practice

1. ## Option 2: "horizontal orientation" ✓ (acceptable but narrower)
- Clean and concise English
- Risk: may be interpreted as exactly horizontal (0° deviation)
- Generally usable only when the source clearly intends strict horizontality

1. ## Option 3: "lying orientation" ✗ (not recommended)
- Not conventional technical or patent terminology
- Sounds unnatural and may distract or confuse the reader
