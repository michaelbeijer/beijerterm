# DmfA

See also: sociaal secretariaat<blockquote>At the end of each quarter, employers have to make a declaration of the salaries, employment details, and contributions for all employees. This declaration is called the **Multifunctional Declaration** (DmfA), which is an abbreviation of **Déclaration multifonctionnelle/multifunctionele Aangifte**. The DmfA declaration is structured using different data levels: employer, employee category, employee, salary, time data, and so on. (https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/1bf0d29d8ca94a2c882d08d9fef02324/4edee7288df34fa2843d02ea9713e09f.html)</blockquote><blockquote>**1 What is DmfA?**

DmfA stands for Multifunctional declaration (‘Déclaration multifonctionnelle’ in French – ‘Multifunctionele aangifte’ in Dutch). With this declaration, employers submit the pay and work time data of their employees. These data are defined and grouped in such a way that all social security institutions can work with the same information. That is why this declaration is called multifunctional.

The DmfA declaration forms a whole with 2 other types of declarations, i.e. Dimona and DRS. The link between these 3 declarations is as follows:

• Dimona, which stands for Immediate declaration (Déclaration immediate’ in French, ‘Onmiddellijke aangifte’ in Dutch) is the declaration by which the employer declares every entry and termination of employment of an employee, i.e. at the beginning or end of an employment relationship. Find more information on Dimona on the Social security enterprise portal (in French);

• DmfA is the quarterly declaration of pay and work time data, i.e. as long as there is an employment relationship;

• DRS, which stands for Declaration of social risks (‘Déclaration des risques sociaux’ in French, ‘Aangifte Sociale Risico’s’ or ‘ASR’ in Dutch), refers to the set of social risk declarations necessary to notify the social security authorities about events that affect an employee's social position. Find more information on DRS on the Social security enterprise portal (in French).
