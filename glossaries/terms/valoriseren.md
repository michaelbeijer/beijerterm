# valoriseren

I basically use this wiki as a notepad and memory aid, so a lot of the content will be quickly written and potentially far from perfect.

The (often Belgian) Dutch term, ‘valoriseren’ is synonymous with ‘ten nut­te ma­ken, te gel­de ma­ken = uit­bui­ten’, and can best be translated as ‘exploit’.
