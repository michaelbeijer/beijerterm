- rinsing agent, flushing agent, flushing compound, rinse aid (What is **rinse aid** for a dishwasher? **Rinse aid is a surfectant product, which perfectly complements any dishwasher thanks to its ability to improve both cleaning and drying results.** It works by reducing the surface tension of the water, which prevents water spots and helps your dishes to come out perfectly dry at the end of the cycle. While providing extra shine to your glasses, it also minimises the chance of etching by thinning out the water bond. (https://www.bosch-home.co.uk/customer-service/get-support/dishwashers/rinse-aid))
