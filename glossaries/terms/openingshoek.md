# openingshoek

1. # Dutch
- openingshoek
- lichtopeningshoek 

1. # English
- **(spread of light emitted by a light source)** opening angle, beam angle (**The entire opening angle of the emitted light of a luminaire is called the beam angle**. This in turn is determined by the design of the reflector. The narrower the beam angle of the reflector, the smaller and thus the brighter the illuminated surface becomes. (https://www.lightculture.com.au/the-enlightenment-series/definitions/))
- **(van lasnaad)** aperture angle<ref name=":0">Comprehensive Dictionary of Industry and Technology (Graham P. Oxtoby)</ref> 
- **(welding)** bevel angle, included angle<ref name=":0" />
- acceptance angle (IATE: **Definition:** maximum angle at which incoming sunlight can be captured by a solar concentrator ~ **Definition reference:** Wikipedia > Acceptance angle (solar concentrator), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_angle_(solar_concentrator)  [28.8.2014] (https://iate.europa.eu/search/result/1741452331047/1))
- **(apertuurhoek)** angular aperture (**IATE** **Definition:** of a reflector or refractor having a focus or approximate focus,the solid angle subtended at the focus by the periphery of the aperture of the reflector or refractor ~ **Definition reference:** IEV 60-32-75 (ibid.))
- beam initial divergence angle (**IATE Definition**: the angle of divergence of the beam after the diaphragm and before the influence of the lens. **Definition reference**: CIRP Dic Production Engineering 9:electron beam machining)
- **(welding)** angle of Vee, included angle, groove angle
- angle of flow (**IATE Definition**: the portion of the cycle of an alternating voltage during which current flows,expressed as an angle // **Definition** reference: IEV 60-19-70)
- **(zuigerkleppen/piston valves)** angle of opening
- subtended angle (angle of intersection of lines normal to tangents at the extremities of a non circular arc)
- real aperture (**IATE** **Definition:** a type of radar system in which the azimuthal resolution is a function of the beam width. **Definition reference:** TELSAT-Earth Observation help Desk, Gloss. of Remote Sensing Terminology, 1998, Belgium.) (a type of radar system in which the azimuthal resolution is a function of the beam width)
