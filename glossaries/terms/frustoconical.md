 **Frustoconical: The Right Word for the Right Shape**
 Another unusual pair of words that are common only in a patent attorney’s lexicon are **frustoconical** and frustopyramidal, meaning **truncated cone** and truncated pyramid, respectively. Frustoconical appears in the claims fo 8432 patents since 1976, frustopyramidal in only 80 patents since 1976.
 
 If you need to describe the shape of a truncated cone, frustoconical is exactly what you need to use. Even though the work is obscure, it is doubtful that it is any harder for a lay person to understand than “truncated cone” than frustoconical.
