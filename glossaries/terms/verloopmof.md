# verloopmof

(1) **reducing** socket/coupling: These terms emphasize the fact that the verloopmof is used to connect pipes of different diameters, with a step-down in size from one end to the other. This is very common in piping systems when transitioning between larger and smaller pipes.
 
 (2) **adapter** socket/sleeve: These terms indicate a broader use, where the verloopmof is adapting between different pipe sizes. However, these terms are less specific than "reducing socket," which might make them less preferable if the exact function is reducing the diameter.
