A chamfer is technically a type of bevel, but the difference between the two is that a bevel is an edge that is sloped and a chamfer is an edge that connects two surfaces at a 45-degree angle, while a bevel’s slope can be any angle except 90 or 45 degrees.
 	
- *bevelled**: Having a sloping edge rather than a squared one.
chamfer: A symmetrical sloping surface at an edge or corner.
