# subsidiaire vordering

- **(civil law)** alternative claim, claim in the alternative
- **(criminal law)** alternative demand, alternative charge (een subsidiaire tenlastelegging/vordering = an alternative charge/demand (Van Dale))

 A "claim in the alternative" means that a party in a legal case is presenting multiple claims, where only one of them needs to be proven true for the party to succeed, essentially stating "if this claim isn't valid, then consider this other claim instead.". This allows a plaintiff to present different legal theories based on the same set of facts, providing flexibility in case one claim is not upheld by the court.
