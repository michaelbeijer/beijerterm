This system, also known as a **master key system** (in reference to the master key which accesses all locks), is used to provide or limit access to different locked areas within a building or complex.)

It helps maintain better control, saves key replacement costs and is convenient, as there are a lower number of keys in circulation. It also provides quick access to all rooms within the premises, e.g. for security staff and management personnel. This is not only convenient but can save lives in case of emergency.)
