 Form-fitting load securing: direct lashing
 Direct lashing is the most effective form of lashing, especially for heavy loads where lashing down is no longer safe. Lashing equipment is directly attached to the load itself. Whereas tie down lashing only increases the friction between load and cargo floor, direct lashing secures the load itself. If the load tends to shift, the lashing means absorbs the forces. In so-called **head lashing**, for example, lashing straps, tension chains or tension cables are attached to the upper corners of the cargo and then to the loading floor. This is a very effective method, as the load is fully secured.
