 The difference between pipe bend and elbow
 
 **“All elbows are pipe bends but not all bends are elbows”**
 **[ellebogen zijn pijpbochten maar niet alle bochten zijn ellebogen”](“All)**
 
 Pipe elbows and pipe bends are both very common pipe fittings products which are used to change the flowing direction in a piping system. 
 
 Sometimes they are interchangeable, but not same.
 
 Elbow is a standard fittings but the bends are custom fabricates. Bends are generally made or fabricated as per the requirement. However elbows are pre-fabricated and standard.
 
 The major difference is the radius of curvature.Elbow generally have radius of curvature between one to twice the diameter of the pipe. Bends have a radius of curvature more than twice the diameter.
 
 Elbows have industrial standards and have limitations to size, bend radius and angle. The angles are usually 45 degree or 90 degrees. All others offsets are classified as pipe bends.
