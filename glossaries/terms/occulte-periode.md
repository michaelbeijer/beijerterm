1. # English
- hidden protection period (https://www.altius.com/en/news/employers-be-aware-of-the-hidden-protection-period-kick-off/ (The “**hidden protection period**” is one of the most remarkable features of the social elections process. The hidden protection period is the period during which candidates already benefit from the specific dismissal protection, even though the candidate lists are only being disclosed to the employer 65 days later. Hence, there is a 65 days-gap during which an employer is not aware of an employee’s candidacy for the social elections and related dismissal protection, reason why it is highly recommended not to proceed with any dismissals during the hidden protection period to avoid a substantial financial liability.))
- period of hidden protection (https://www.aoshearman.com/en/insights/social-elections-2024-watch-out-for-the-hidden-protection-period (However, the formal lists of candidates must only be submitted at the latest 35 days after the posting of that same notice (X + 35), ie between 19 March and 1 April 2024 (again, depending on your election date). Hence, there is **a 65-day period of “hidden protection”** from X – 30 to X + 35 during which candidates are already fully protected against dismissal but the employer is not yet formally aware of who these candidates are. ))
- ‘blackout period’ of the dismissal protection (occulte periode/période occulte) (https://www.pwclegal.be/en/news/social-elections-2020--hide-and-seek---the-blackout-period-impac.html (“Belgian legislation grants a specific dismissal protection to persons who are candidates to become (regular or substitute) employee representatives for the works council or the committee for prevention and protection at work. This protection against dismissal starts on date X-30, falling sometime between 12 and 25 January 2020, and marks the start of the so-called **“blackout period” of the dismissal protection (occulte periode/période occulte).**”))
