1. ## Examples of usage

- synthetics can **pill** but otherwise wear fairly well
- (pilled as adjective) no matter how carefully you wash them, some sweaters end up **pilled** and bobbly
- This new fabric treatment enables the garment to resist shrinking, **pilling**, fading and wrinkles while remaining breathable.
- Those tiny little felt guys that I made for Amelia just before she was born have been loved a little and have ended up filthy and terribly **pilled**.
- The yarn **pilled** up a lot, and though it was soft it always looked kind of weird on me so I rarely wore it.
- Fabric made with this tandem-spun yarn doesn't **pill**, since the core fiber - often a high-tenacity polyester that is prone to cause **pilling** - is almost completely encased in cotton, which doesn't **pill**.
- High lanolin content can prevent **pilling**, but the high-lanolin yarn garments are usually heavy outer-wear.
- When washed, the fleece **pilled** and changed shape which meant that the garment ‘grew’ as it was worn.
