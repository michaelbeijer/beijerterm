1. # Definitions
 Having been a lawyer in private practice, I've used the term innumerable times.
 
 "Concluant" or "Concluante" is the party for whom a lawyer is submitting a brief ("conclusies") to a Tribunal or Court. It can be the claiming or the defending party.'' (André Sainderichin, Proz.com) (https://www.proz.com/kudoz/flemish-to-english/law-general/1311885-conculante.html)

 The term "concluante" in a Flemish text must be interpreted as the "party appearing before the Court/he who pleads".
 
 Obviously you can't translate it as that, so in EN you have to replace it with the specific party e.g. defendant/claimant/plaintiff/appellant/respondent - as the case may be (look at your preceding context) and depending on whether your terms are US/UK.
 
 e.g. bankruptcy of the defendant 
 
 "Conclusies" in this context would mean the pleadings.
 
 I'm a qualified lawyer myself and translate Belgian NL ("Flemish") legal on a daily basis, so can vouch from that point of view.
 
 Hope this helps (Deborah Irene do Carmo, Proz.com) (https://www.translatorscafe.com/tcterms/en-US/question.aspx?id=1697)
