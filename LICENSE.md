## Philosophy

We believe terminology should be free. Lexical data, translations, and terminology 
are facts about language. Facts cannot and should not be owned.

Many glossaries in this collection have been compiled from various online sources,
including government publications, academic resources, corporate glossaries, and
community contributions. All data has been processed, cleaned, reformatted, and
often enhanced. We acknowledge original sources where known.

If you believe any content should not be included, please open an issue on GitHub.
